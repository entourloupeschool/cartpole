# CartPole Solution with Vanilla Policy Gradient
## A reinforcement learning agent trained using the Vanilla Policy Gradient algorithm to solve the CartPole problem from OpenAI's gym.

This project is a reflection of the work and knowledge I've acquired. For a detailed introduction and background on the CartPole problem, please refer to [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/).
